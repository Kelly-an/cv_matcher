# Goal

The goal of this project is to fetch job offers from the pole emploi API. Then, allow user to upload resume. And match resume to job offers.
- It would return top 20 matching offers (ordered by skill matching, job offer creation date etc.).
- It would mention skills that are often referred to in job offers but lacking in user's resume.
- It would provide a title for the resume based on matching skill (not resume title itself)
